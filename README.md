# jump-ionic2
Dockerfile (maybe more to come) for creating images used for developing Ionic 2 Portable Web Apps and Angular 2 apps.

See https://blog.saddey.net/2016/07/03/using-docker-to-create-ionic-2-pwa-developer-environment/

Note: This image is targeted towards development, i.e. all-and-everything runs as root.
